          <p> This is an interpretation of the classic game scrabble to be played single player. It plays a bit diffrently from how regular scrabble plays, so listen up to the following rules:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The goal is to get the highest score</li>
            <li>Word score is calculated by value of tiles in play and bonuses</li>
            <li>You can discard tiles in your hand, but that will subtract their value from the total score</li>
            <li>You can always resart the game or reset the current word, but discarded tiles will never come back</li>
            <li>The bag holds the tiles that are remaining but not in play, also known as "Tiles left"</li>
            <li>Once you have no moves left, you can select "End Game"</li>
            <li>If you end the game with extra tiles in your bag, the total value of those tiles will be subtracted from your score, so use as many as you can!</li>
            <li>Your total score is calculated by the following: score = word values - discarded tiles - remaining tiles in the bag</li>
          </ul>
